=== Timing-Aware Fill Insertions with Design-Rule and Density Constraints

Metal fill insertion has become an essential step to reduce dielectric thickness variation and improve pattern uniformity, which is important in mitigating process variations, thereby achieving better manufacturing yield. However, metal fills could induce coupling capacitance, which is not often considered in existing works that typically focus more on pattern density uniformity, incurring significant problems in timing closure.

=== Using Cache Optimization Method to Reduce Network Traffic in Communication Systems Based on Cloud Computing

The overwhelming increase of population will lead to an increase network traffic usage. 
In most products, local cache mechanism is implemented for the purpose of reducing the network traffics. 
However, Due to storage space limitations, lot of times, cache will get purged when there are lots of queries sent and replaced by other newest queries. It is not an efficient by using traditional methodology to build or forming cache.

=== Block diagonal dominanceâ€‘based dynamic programming for detecting community

Clustering or partition is a fundamental work for graph or network. 
Detecting communities is a typical clustering, which divides a network into several parts according to the modularity. 
Community detection is a critical challenge for designing scalable, adaptive and survivable trust management protocol for a community of interest based social IoT system. Most of the existed methods on community detection suffer from a common issue that the number of communities should be prior decided. This urges us to estimate the number of communities from the data by some way.
